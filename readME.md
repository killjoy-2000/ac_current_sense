This is a simple circuit for dectecing if a appliance is on or off.
The working principle is pretty simple. AC line is feed in a full bridge rectifier. Then the voltage is lowered using a voltage divider. The corrosponding resistors values are 560k &  6.8k respectively. LED is connected to the 6.8k resistor. 
A LDR is connected on the top of the LED and the system is sealed. It works kind of like photo diode.
LDR is then conneced to an Arduino.
